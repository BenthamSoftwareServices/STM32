I can see you already have the basic infrastructure set up for your Nucleo L432KC board. Let me modify your code to add text printing functionality using the printf redirection that's already defined in your code.
Modified STM32 Code for Text PrintingCode 
Here's what I've added to your existing Nucleo L432KC code:
Key Additions:

Added necessary includes:

#include <stdio.h> for printf functionality
#include <string.h> for strlen function
Note they must be placed as below, or CubeMX will delete them if the code is regenerated.

/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
/* USER CODE END Includes */


Added variables:

uint32_t counter to track LED toggles
char message[100] buffer for formatting messages


Added a print_message function:

Direct UART transmission without using printf
Useful for simple string outputs


Implemented startup messages:

Added welcome banner at initialization
Shows two different methods of printing (direct UART and printf)


Enhanced the main loop:

Added message showing toggle count and LED state
Added system uptime display using HAL_GetTick()
Used both print methods for demonstration


Improved error handling:

Added LED blinking in Error_Handler
Implemented the assert_failed function to print debugging info


Using Your Code:
Your existing code already had the most important parts in place:

UART2 configuration (connected to ST-Link VCP)
LED on PB3 setup
Printf redirection via __io_putchar

I simply leveraged what you already had and added the text printing functionality.
To Get This Working:

Make sure in your STM32CubeIDE project settings:

Under Project Properties → C/C++ Build → Settings → Tool Settings → MCU GCC Linker → Miscellaneous
Add -u _printf_float if you plan to print floating point values


Enable the "Use MicroLIB" option or make sure the small printf library is selected
Connect to the Virtual COM Port:

In STM32CubeIDE, go to Window → Show View → Terminal
Configure it for the COM port assigned to your Nucleo board
Set 115200 baud, 8N1



After flashing this code, you should see the welcome messages and the ongoing status updates as the LED blinks.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. 3.7 Sonnet
